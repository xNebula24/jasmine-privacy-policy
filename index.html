    <h1>Jasmine Privacy Policy Agreement</h1>

    <p>Jasmine: Website Comments & Reviews (Jasmine) values its users' privacy. This Privacy Policy will help you understand how we collect and use personal information from those who visit our website or make use of our online facilities and services, and what we will and will not do with the information we collect. Our Policy has been designed and created to ensure those affiliated with Jasmine of our commitment and realization of our obligation not only to meet, but to exceed, most existing privacy standards.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Policy at any given time. If you want to make sure that you are up to date with the latest changes, we advise you to frequently visit this page. If at any point in time Jasmine decides to make use of any personally identifiable information on file, in a manner vastly different from that which was stated when this information was initially collected, the user or users shall be promptly notified by email. Users at that time shall have the option as to whether to permit the use of their information in this separate manner. </p>

    <p>This Policy applies to Jasmine, and it governs any and all data collection and usage by us. Through the use of The Jasmine Extension, you are therefore consenting to the data collection procedures expressed in this Policy. </p>

    <p>Please note that this Policy does not govern the collection and use of information by companies that Jasminedoes not control, nor by individuals not employed or managed by us. If you visit a website that we mention or link to, be sure to review its privacy policy before providing the site with information. It is highly recommended and suggested that you review the privacy policies and statements of any website you choose to use or frequent to better understand the way in which websites garner,

        5. The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <p>It is always up to you whether to disclose personally identifiable information to us, although if you elect not to do so, we

    types of information, such as:

    <p>Please rest assured that this site will only collect personal information that you knowingly and willingly provide to us by way of
    surveys, completed membership forms, and emails. It is the intent of this site to use personal information only for the purpose
    for which it was requested, and any additional uses specifically provided for on this Policy.</p>

    <h2>Why We Collect Information and For How Long</h2>

    <p>We are collecting your data for several reasons:
        · To better understand your needs and provide you with the services you have requested;
        · To fulfill our legitimate interest in improving our services and products;
        · To send you promotional emails containing information we think you may like when we have your consent to do so;

        · To customize our website according to your online behavior and personal preferences.</p>

    <p>The data we collect from you will be stored for no longer than necessary. The length of time we retain said information will be
    determined based upon the following criteria: the length of time your personal information remains relevant; the length of time
    it is reasonable to keep records to demonstrate that we have fulfilled our duties and obligations; any limitation periods within
    which claims might be made; any retention periods prescribed by law or recommended by regulators, professional bodies or
    associations; the type of contract we have with you, the existence of your consent, and our legitimate interest in keeping such
    information as stated in this Policy.</p>
    
    <h2>Use of Information Collected</h2>

    <p>Jasmine does not now, nor will it in the future, sell, rent or lease any of its customer lists and/or names to any third parties.</p>

    <p>Jasmine may collect and may make use of personal information to assist in the operation of our website and to ensure
    delivery of the services you need and request. At times, we may find it necessary to use personally identifiable information as
    a means to keep you informed of other possible products and/or services that may be available to you from The Jasmine
    Extension.</p>

    <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>

    <p>Jasmine may not use or disclose the information provided by you except under the following circumstances:
      · as necessary to provide services or products you have ordered;
      · in other ways described in this Policy or to which you have otherwise consented;
      · in the aggregate with other information in such a way so that your identity cannot reasonably be determined;
      · as required by law, or in response to a subpoena or search warrant;
      · to outside auditors who have agreed to keep the information confidential;
      · as necessary to enforce the Terms of Service;
      · as necessary to maintain, safeguard and preserve all the rights and property of Jasmine.</p>

    <h2>Non-Marketing Purposes</h2>
    <p>Jasmine greatly respects your privacy. We do maintain and reserve the right to contact you if needed for non-marketing
    purposes (such as bug alerts, security breaches, account issues, and/or changes in Jasmine products and services). In
    certain circumstances, we may use our website, or other public means to post a notice.</p>

    <h2>Children under the age of 13</h2>
    <p>Jasmine's website is not directed to, and does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from, children under the age of thirteen (13). If it is determined that such information has been inadvertently collected on anyone under the age of thirteen (13), we shall immediately take the necessary steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our system's database, or in the alternative, that verifiable parental consent is obtained for the use and storage of such information. Anyone under the age of thirteen (13) must seek and obtain parent or guardian permission to use this website.</p>

    <h2>Unsubscribe or Opt-Out</h2>
    <p>All users and visitors to our extension have the option to discontinue receiving communications from us by way of email.

    <h2>Notice to European Union Users </h2>
    <p>Jasmine's operations are located primarily in the United States. If you provide information to us, the information will be transferred out of the European Union (EU) and sent to the United States. (The adequacy decision on the EU-US Privacy became operational on August 1, 2016. This framework protects the fundamental rights of anyone in the EU whose personal data is transferred to the United States for commercial purposes. It allows the free transfer of data to companies that are certified in the US under the Privacy Shield.) By providing personal information to us, you are consenting to its storage and use as described in this Policy.</p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Jasmine takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (e.g.         credit card information), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the             address of the webpage.</p>
    <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or         customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers and servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. This is all done to           prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of the user's personal information under our control. </p>
    
    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By using this website, you are hereby accepting the terms and conditions stipulated within the Privacy Policy Agreement. If you are not in agreement with our terms and conditions, then you should refrain from           further use of our sites. In addition, your continued use of our website following the posting of any updates or changes to our terms and conditions shall mean that you agree and accept such changes. </p>
